a lil brief of what needs to be done

highly visual blog with crispy images, that do not take time to load. It should be able to view or read, sign up should capture username, email and password. Update we use a third party plugin (wizwick?) Must be able to save user data in a cookie (install cookie parcel?).
 
on the site you need a Home/Landing page. Must have at least 3 of the latest blog posts visible on the page

a blog archive page with all the blogs

footer and nav

sign up page or pop up

update and delete button should show to signed in users

install nodemon so the app refreshes when you interact with the page

add confirmations for action like delete
